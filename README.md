# TBOI-prototipe-Godot
This is an old project created in Godot for learning purpouses, recreating the basis of the game 'The Binding Of Isaac'. This include procedural generation, movement, upgrades, damage, enemies, sound effects, dead and restart.
All assets and music are owned by Nicalis, original autors of TBOI
